        <p>SCENE II; CHRYSALE, ARISTE.<br>

            ARI. Good day to you, brother.<br>
            
            CHRY. And to you also, brother.<br>
            
            ARI. Do you know what brings me here?<br>
            
            CHRY. No, I do not; but I am ready to hear it, if it pleases you to
            tell me.<br>
            
            ARI. You have known Clitandre for some time now?<br>
            
            CHRY. Certainly; and he often comes to our house.<br>
